<h2 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Chelsea Caines</h2>
<h4 align="center">A passionate and growing Full Stack Developer from Northern Newfoundland, Canada</h4>

### About Me

+ Completed in 2024, I am a Software Development graduate with GetBuilding, formally known as GetCoding. This program consisted of one-on-one coaching over several modules. I was able to complete my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is a simple financial budget tracking software called MyFunds. Feel free to check it out at https://chelseajcaines.github.io/MyFunds/. My second project was a game that is fun for all ages, Balloon Pop. Built using React.js, Balloon Pop is a word puzzle game that can be played solo or against a friend. You can play the game at https://chelseajcaines.github.io/balloon-pop-game/. My third and final project was a full stack project called MonieJar. The frontend, built using a React template from MUI, is an upgraded version of MyFunds. The backend was built using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and AWS. Using these tools I was able to add features to my budgeting app like user authentication, and implement testing of my code to ensure good CI/CD. I am currently working on the deployment of this app, but the link will be posted here when it is live.
