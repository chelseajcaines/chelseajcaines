### About Me

+ Enrolled in 2023, I am currently a Software Development student with GetCoding. While completing the first module of this program, I was able to complete my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is a simple financial budget tracking software called MyFunds, and it can be viewed on both desktops and mobile devices. MyFunds allows the user to keep track of their personal finances by creating budgets, listing incomes/expenses, and even create savings goals. Once entered, the user information is saved within the browser using LocalStorage. With this key feature the user is able to later edit and remove information to their satisfaction. Feel free to check out MyFunds at https://chelseajcaines.github.io/MyFunds/. It would be greatly appreciated! I am planning on adding extra features to my project including a Sign Up/Log In feature, an overview dashboard that includes quick action controls, different color theme options, and allowing the user to drag/drop certain items so they can organize by priority. Learning the next set of languages and tools in this program will help me achieve these goals.
